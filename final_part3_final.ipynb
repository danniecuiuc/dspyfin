Finally, you will use backtrader to backtest a portfolio strategy based on the industry that you selected.\n\n3.1. Use Intrinio API to pull the daily stock prices of all the constituents of your selected industry. Make sure that you have at least 100 trading days.\n\n3.2 Select one company (stock) from your selected industry. In a short paragraph explain why you selected that particular company. For the company that you selected, create a long/short trading strategy. Make sure that you determine appropriate short and long trading windows and plot your strategy.\n\n3.3 Backtest a $100,000 long/short portfolio using Pandas and plot your portfolio value.\n\n3.4 Evaluate your trading strategy, calculate the portfolio sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). In a short paragraph interpret the results.\n\n3.5 Use backtrader to backtest a portfolio based on the industry that you selected. Make sure that there are executed trades and upload the plot that backtrader generated (use provided notebook)\n\nSubmit a clean and organized notebook and the corresponding dataset answering the questions for this part."

This could be proved by the fact that the percentage price change of Adobe in 30 days, YTD, and in 12 months are 14.15%, 4.25%, and 21.35% repectively, which are all POSITIVE. <br>Although this year COVID-19 negatively affected many companies, Adobe still have positive returns year to date and within a month. So it might be regarded as a defensive business, which could still perform good even in bad economic situations. This might due to its price lies on a good fundamental basis and business nature. As we can see, the 12 month percentage change in price is 21.35, which is pretty high, implying that Adobe is doing good in long-run basis. <br>Also, the PE ratio of Adobe is 51.99x. In comparison, the 5 companies with good performance listed above have PE ratios from 21.42x to 75.79x. The current PE ratio of Adobe is good, which shows that investors are expecting high growth rates of Adobe in the future. **"
